In the last sentence, whether it is the official dota2 case opening or the three-way dota2 case opening, all the case opening experience has a lot of randomness, please be cautious when you have bad luck.

The following is the opening record of me. Small profit overall. I only opened \$145 case once and get a Genuine Golden Pale Mausoleum. And i can spend \$15 to get a Scorching Talon. But i lose money when i opened a \$15 case for a Team Pennant: NaVi.
